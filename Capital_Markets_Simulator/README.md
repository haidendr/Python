# üìà Capital Markets Profitability Simulator

A Python-based analytics project that models and visualizes the profitability of financial products across global capital markets using macroeconomic indicators.

This project simulates investment returns, calculates financial metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and provides strategic recommendations based on risk-adjusted performance across countries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Converts dates to datetime
- Renames columns to snake_case
- Selects relevant indicators
- Handles missing values with forward-fill strategy

### 2. **Scenario Definition**
- Defines economic profiles for selected countries (e.g., U.S., China, Japan)
- Extracts interest rate, inflation, GDP growth, and risk score

### 3. **Cash Flow Simulation**
- Models annual cash flows using compound interest formulas
- Adjustable for different principal amounts and time horizons

### 4. **Profitability Metrics**
- Calculates **NPV** using discount rates
- Computes **IRR** for each simulated investment
- Summarizes results in a comparison table

### 5. **Visualization**
- Bar plots for NPV and IRR by country
