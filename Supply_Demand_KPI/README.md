# Inventory Health Monitor for Automotive Stock

This project analyzes dealership inventory data to simulate reorder logic and calculate key supply chain KPIs. Built entirely in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, it demonstrates how data-driven insights can support smarter inventory planning and forecasting decisions in the automotive retail space.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Analysis**: Tracks stock levels across vehicle models and brands
- **Reorder Simulation**: Flags models that fall below a defined inventory threshold
- **Supply Chain KPIs**:
  - Days of Supply
  - Inventory Turnover
  - Stockout Risk
- **Forecasting Module**: Projects inventory depletion over time based on estimated daily sales
- **Visualizations**: Includes bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and distribution plots for intuitive insight

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [FourFront Cars for Sale Dataset](https://www.fourfront.us/data/datasets/cars-for-sale-database-sample/)
- **File Used**: `Car_data.xlsx`
  - `InventoryPrice` sheet: Contains model-level inventory and pricing
  - `dealer` sheet: Contains vehicle-level stock details and dates

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- openpyxl (for Excel file handling)

---

## Sample Visuals

- Inventory levels by model
- Days of supply distribution
- Inventory turnover vs. stockout risk
- Forecasted inventory after 30 days

---

## Summary & Insights

This notebook provides a foundational framework for inventory health monitoring in automotive retail. Key takeaways include:

- Models with low days of supply and high turnover are at risk of stockouts
- Forecasting helps anticipate inventory depletion and guide reorder decisions
- Visual analytics reveal patterns in inventory distribution and aging stock

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate lead time and safety stock logic
- Add real-time sales data for dynamic forecasting
- Build an interactive dashboard using Tableau or Streamlit

---

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter  
3. Install required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `openpyxl`)  
4. Run the notebook step-by-step to explore the analysis
